description: Modify plan and code after implementation; support revert or apply new approach.
---

## Goal

Modify a feature plan after partial/full implementation. Support reverting to a previous git state or applying new requirement changes with both code and documentation sync.

## Prerequisites

- Feature name (kebab-case, e.g., `user-authentication`)
- Planning doc exists: `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`
- Git repo initialized (for tracking code state)

## Workflow Alignment

- Provide brief status updates (1–3 sentences) before/after important actions.
- Update planning doc when making changes.
- Do NOT auto-commit; user reviews all changes before pushing.

## Step 1: Load Current State

Ask for feature name (must be kebab-case).

Load and summarize:

1. **Planning doc**: Current goal, scope, implementation phases, completion status

Display summary:

```
Feature: user-authentication
Plan: Create user login + registration endpoints

Implementation Progress:
- Phase 1 (Database): Complete [x]
  Files: src/db/schema.ts
- Phase 2 (API Endpoints): In Progress [3/4]
  Files: src/api/users.ts, src/api/auth.ts
- Phase 3 (Frontend): Not Started [ ]
  Files: src/components/Login.tsx

Total files touched: 4
```

## Step 2: Scope of Change (Q&A)

Ask user what's changing:

**1. Type of modification:**
a) Modify goal/scope (entire plan changes)
b) Modify specific phase(s) (tactical change)
c) Revert to previous approach (git reset)
d) Other (describe)

**2a. If modifying goal/scope:**

- What's the new goal/scope?
- How does it impact existing tasks?

**2b. If modifying specific phase(s):**

- Which phase(s)? (list by name)
- What requirement/approach is changing?

**2c. If reverting approach:**

- Show last 5 commits; ask which to revert to
- Or reset to specific phase (revert all code changes after phase X)?

## Step 3: Apply Changes

### Option A: Revert to Previous Git State

If user selects revert:

1. **Identify affected files & changes**:

   - Parse planning doc; list all files modified in affected phase(s)
   - Show file list that needs reverting:
     ```
     Files to revert (manual):
     - src/api/users.ts (lines 45–120)
     - src/db/schema.ts (lines 10–30)
     - tests/api.test.ts (delete entire file)
     ```

2. **Manual revert guidance**:

   - For MODIFIED files: show current state vs. target state (code snippets/line ranges)
   - For DELETED files: ask user to delete manually
   - Ask: "Ready to manually revert these files?"

3. **If user confirms**:

   - User manually reverts files (copy-paste old code back, undo in IDE, etc.)
   - Update planning doc:

     - Mark affected phases/tasks `[ ]` (reset to pending)
     - Add "Modification History" entry:

       ```
       ## Modification History

       ### Revert [Date]: {Reason}
       - **Reverted phases**: Phase X, Y
       - **Reason**: [user provided]
       - **Files manually reverted**: [list]
       - **Affected tasks reset**: [ ] Task 1, [ ] Task 2, ...
       ```

4. **Result**: Docs updated; tasks reset; ready to re-implement with new approach

### Option B: Apply New Changes

If user selects new approach:

1. **Update planning doc**:

   - Modify goal/scope section if changed
   - Update affected task(s) with new approach
   - Update pseudo-code to match new approach
   - Add "Modification History" section:

     ```
     ## Modification History

     ### Change [Date]: {Title}
     - **Previous approach**: [original details]
     - **New approach**: [new details]
     - **Reason**: [user provided]
     - **Affected phases**: Phase X, Y
     ```

2. **Update implementation phases**:

   - For affected phases:
     - Modify pseudo-code to match new approach
     - Reset incomplete tasks `[ ]` (if approach changed significantly)
   - Keep completed tasks as-is (do not re-implement)
   - Update "Implementation Plan" section with new structure (files/logic outline)

3. **Show git impact**:
   - Highlight files that may need re-editing
   - Ask: "Ready to re-implement with new approach?" (yes/no)

## Step 4: Confirmation & Audit Trail

Before finalizing, show:

1. **Updated planning doc** snippet (modified sections)
2. **Git state** (files that will be changed)

Ask: **"Apply changes and update doc?"** (yes/no)

If **yes**:

- Save updated planning doc
- If revert: `git status` shows reverted files (unstaged)
- If new approach: doc updated; code changes staged for review

If **no**:

- Rollback changes to doc
- Discard any temporary changes

## Step 5: Next Actions

**After manual revert**:

- "Docs updated. Affected tasks reset to `[ ]`. Run `/execute-plan` to re-implement Phase X with new approach."

**After apply new approach**:

- If only pseudo-code/docs changed (no code revert needed): "Continue current phase with `/execute-plan`."
- If code changes needed (revert old approach + implement new): "Manually update code files first, then run `/execute-plan`."
- "When done, run `/code-review` to validate standards."

## Important Notes

- **Manual revert**: User manually reverts code files (no git reset); AI guides the process
- **Multi-feature safe**: Works when implementing multiple features simultaneously (selective revert possible)
- **Backward compatible**: Works with both phase-based and non-phase-based planning docs
- **Audit trail**: "Modification History" section preserves decision rationale and affected files
- **Idempotent**: Safe to re-run; modification history accumulates
- **Safe defaults**: Asks confirmation before any changes; user always has final say

## Example Flow

```
User: I want to modify plan
Agent: Load state, show summary

User: Revert Phase 2 (API Endpoints) - use different auth approach
Agent: Identify affected files (src/api/users.ts, src/api/auth.ts)
       Show current state vs. target state (pseudo-code + old implementation)
       Ask: Ready to manually revert these files?

User: Yes, I'll manually revert
Agent: (User manually copies old code back or undoes changes in IDE)
       Update planning doc:
       - Mark Phase 2 tasks [ ] (reset)
       - Add Modification History: Phase 2 reverted, reason: better auth strategy

Agent: Phase 2 reset. Ready to re-implement with new auth approach?
       Run: /execute-plan
```
