# AI Agent Workflow Standards

## Core Coding Philosophy

Apply these principles when providing solutions, generating code, or making technical decisions:

### 1. Simplicity First

- Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
- Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary abstractions
- Simple code = fewer bugs, easier to maintain, easier to understand
- Ask: "Can this be done more simply while still working?"
- Complexity is a last resort, not a first choice

### 2. Deep Understanding

- Understand requirements fully before planning or coding
- If unclear about requirement, flow, edge cases, or expected behavior → Ask the user
- Never assume or guess - clarification prevents wasted effort
- Ask questions like:
  - "What should happen when X occurs?"
  - "How should the system behave if Y fails?"
  - "Is this the expected flow: A → B → C?"

### 3. Multiple Options

- Provide 2-5 solution options for each problem when appropriate
- Present trade-offs clearly: pros/cons, complexity, performance, maintainability
- Format: "Option 1: [approach] - Pros: [...] Cons: [...]"
- Let user choose based on their context and priorities
- Not every problem has one "best" solution

### 4. Think Ahead

- While keeping solutions simple, consider future implications:
  - How will this scale with more data/users?
  - What if requirements change slightly?
  - Are there security vulnerabilities?
  - What are performance bottlenecks?
- Balance: Simple now + adaptable for reasonable future needs
- Do not build for hypothetical futures, but be aware of likely changes

**Philosophy in practice:**

- Simplicity: Use built-in array methods instead of custom loop logic
- Deep Understanding: "Should this API return 404 or 400 for invalid IDs?"
- Multiple Options: "We can use: 1) localStorage (simple), 2) IndexedDB (scalable), or 3) Backend API (persistent)"
- Think Ahead: "This works for 100 items, but consider pagination for 10,000+"

## Core Workflow: Plan → Implement → Test → Review

### Workflow Alignment

- **Plan:** Create feature planning doc at `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md` before coding. Do not start until planning exists and is agreed.
- **Implement:** Provide 1-3 sentence status updates before operations. Use file editing tools, not copy-paste. Update checkboxes `[ ]` → `[x]` in planning doc.
- **Test:** Run linter/type-check/build on changed files after each batch. Auto-fix issues (up to 3 attempts) before asking for help.
- **Review:** When complete, validate against planning doc acceptance criteria and CODE_CONVENTIONS.md.

## File Structure

### Planning Documents

- Location: `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md` (kebab-case)
- Must include: Goal, Acceptance Criteria (GWT), Risks, Implementation Phases, Follow-ups
- Template: `docs/ai/planning/feature-template.md`

### Project Standards

- Coding conventions: `docs/ai/project/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`
- Architecture guide: `docs/ai/project/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- Language templates: `docs/ai/project/template-convention/`

## Tooling Strategy

- Prefer semantic search across codebase; use grep only for exact matches
- Default to parallel execution for independent operations
- Quality tools: ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier (auto-format/auto-fix when possible)

## Communication

- Use Markdown only when necessary; backticks for `files/dirs/functions/classes`
- Status updates before/after important actions
- Mirror user's chat language; code/comments always in English

## Code Presentation

- Existing code: cite with `startLine:endLine:filepath` (no language tag)
- New code: fenced blocks with language tag, no line numbers

## TODO Policy

- For medium/large tasks: create todos (≤14 words, verb-led)
- Keep only ONE `in_progress` item
- Update immediately after progress; mark completed upon finish

## Git Workflow

- Feature branches: `feature/{name}` (match planning doc name)
- Commit format: `[phase] brief description`
- Examples: `[planning] create user auth plan`, `[phase-1] implement database schema`

## Slash Commands

- `/create-plan` - Generate planning doc
- `/execute-plan` - Implement tasks from planning doc
- `/modify-plan` - Modify plan after implementation
- `/code-review` - Validate against standards
- `/generate-standards` - Update CODE_CONVENTIONS.md
- `/writing-test` - Generate tests from acceptance criteria
- `/init-chat` - Load project rules (AGENTS.md)

## Quality Gates

### Before marking task complete:

- Code matches planning doc specification
- Linting passes (no warnings)
- Type checking passes (if applicable)
- Build succeeds (if applicable)
- Checkbox updated in planning doc: `[x]`
